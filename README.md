# Game-of-Pawns

This is our Level 1 Term 1 project. We built a chess game "Game of Pawns". We used C++ for our project and also iGraphics library.
Hope you like it.

Note:
You will find all the codes under the project file "CHESSBEGINSHEREatHOME" 
To run the codes you have to install the iGraphics Library from "Install iGraphics" folder.
Or you can simply run the game from "MyIGraphics.exe" file adjusting your screen resolution accordingly.
